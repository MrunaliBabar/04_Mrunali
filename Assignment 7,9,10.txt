7. value of i=11
value of n=0

final value of i and n if we use ++i that is prefix operator = 
i=11
n=1

9.Because we use postfix increment operator which prints or stores value first and then increment it. so 6 is printed twice

10. avalue=8933.234; // This is Assignment Expression which stores the value 8933.234 in variable aValue
    aValue++;// This is increment Statement which is used to increments aValue by 1
    System.out.println("hello world!"); This is method invocation  statement which print Hello World on console
    Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle();// Object of class Bicycle i.e mybike is created
